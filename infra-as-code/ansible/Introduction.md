# Ansible get started

 ### **What is Ansible?**
-  Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool that automates configuration management, intra-service orchestration, and other IT needs, Ansible is widely used by DevOps professionals.

<br>

 ### **Advantages of the ANSIBLE:**
-  The advantages of Ansible are that he models your IT infrastructure, describing how all of your systems are interrelated, rather than managing one system at a time, what sets it apart is the fact that it uses agents and no additional custom security infrastructure and thus makes it easier to deploy.
- Something very important is the use of a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks).
- We can also see that Ansible connects us to its nodes and runs small programs, which are called "Ansible Modules". These programs were created to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible runs these modules (by SSH by default) and removes them when finished.

### **Relevant information of the ANSIBLE:**
- Ansible is a tool to optimize the infrastructure of an environment, in which we can have a "playbook.yml" that will configure tasks in any operating system.

## **Explain Idempotence on Ansible**
- ***Idempotence*** it is when some operations can be applied several times without the result value changing after the initial application.
- Most of the modules in Ansible are idempotent, that is, they will only be executed if it is really necessary, otherwise it goes skip on to the next task.
